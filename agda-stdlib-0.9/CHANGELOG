-- Release notes for Agda standard library version 0.9
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The library has been tested using Agda version 2.4.2.1.

Note that no guarantees are made about backwards or forwards
compatibility, the library is still at an experimental stage.

If you want to compile the library using the MAlonzo compiler, then
you should first install some supporting Haskell code, for instance as
follows:

  cd ffi
  cabal install

Currently the library does not support the Epic or JavaScript compiler
backends.

Important changes since 0.8.1:

* Data.List.NonEmpty

  Non-empty lists are no longer defined in terms of Data.Product._×_,
  instead, now they are defined as record with fields head and tail.

* Reflection API

  ** Quoting levels was fixed. This fix could break some code (see
     Agda issue 1207).

  ** The Reflection.type function returns a normalised Reflection.Type
     and quoteTerm returns an η-contracted Reflection.Term now. These
     changes could break some code (see Agda issue 1269).

  ** The primitive function for showing names, primShowQName, is now
     exposed as Reflection.showName.

* Removed compatibility modules for Props -> Properties rename

  Use Foo.Properties.Bar instead of Foo.Props.Bar.

backends.

Important changes since 0.8:

* Reflection API

  Agda 2.4.2 added support for literals, function definitions, pattern
  matching lambdas and absurd clause/patterns (see Agda release
  notes). The new supported entities were added to the Reflection.agda
  module.

* Modules renamed

  Foo.Props.Bar -> Foo.Properties.Bar

  The current compatibility modules Foo.Props.Bar will be removed in
  the next release.
